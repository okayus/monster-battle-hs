 * The player SPA's calls to the API.

 * does not exist — so it is a value the caller has to handle, not an exception
 * it might forget to catch.
 *
 * Paths are relative (`/api/...`). The browser only ever talks to its own
 * origin: Vite proxies /api in development and Hono serves both in production,
 * so there is no base URL to configure and no CORS (docs/01-architecture.md).
